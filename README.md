# Mimic
A dApp on the Ethereum network that serves as a decentralized marketplace for investment strategies. Investors can subscribe to different funds, which are controlled by managers who place order to buy and sell stocks. These orders are then distributed to the subscribed investors who execute these trades to mimic the strategy of the fund.
